## ‚úÖ Indie Eligibility Criteria

A developer is considered "indie" if they meet **ALL** of the following:

1. **Team size ‚â§ 10** people
2. **No major publisher** with funding/control (distribution partnerships are OK)
3. **Own their IP** or share it only among team members
4. **No corporate parent company**

### Important Notes

- Having a studio name, sole proprietorship, or small LLC is **allowed**
- Many indie developers operate as legal entities for tax/liability reasons
- VC funding alone doesn't disqualify if other criteria are met
- Small corps without parent companies can still be indie

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-Time Warnings

The system provides non-blocking warnings when:

- **Team size > 10**: "This may make you ineligible for Indie perks; you can still continue as a Studio."
- **Has publisher = true**: "Having a major publisher may make you ineligible for Indie perks."
- **Company type = CORP**: "Ensure you don't have a parent company to maintain indie status."
- **VC + large team**: "VC funding combined with large team size may indicate non-indie status."

These warnings appear in real-time as the user fills out the form.

---

## üîç Moderation Workflow

### 1. Registration
- Developer fills out form
- System auto-calculates `isIndieEligible`
- Status set to `PENDING`
- IP address captured for attestation

### 2. Manual Review Queue
Moderators review:
- Team size
- Evidence links (Steam/itch.io pages, GitHub, etc.)
- Publisher mentions on store pages
- Funding sources
- Company structure

### 3. Decision
- **APPROVED**: Developer gains indie perks
- **REJECTED**: Can appeal with more evidence
- **APPEALING**: Under review after rejection

### 4. Appeals
- Developers can provide additional evidence
- Status changes to `APPEALING`
- Re-reviewed by moderator

  // Moderation
  verificationStatus VerificationStatus @default(PENDING)
  reviewedAt         DateTime?
