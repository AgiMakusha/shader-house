- `/profile/gamer`
- `/dashboard`
- `/settings`

### Auth-Only Routes
Authenticated users are automatically redirected from:
- `/login` ‚Üí `/profile/{role}`
- `/signup` ‚Üí `/profile/{role}`

### Role-Based Access

### GameIcon

## User Actions

### Logout
Both profile pages include a **Logout** button in the top-right:

2. Plays door sound effect
3. Redirects to `/login` after 300ms

### Quick Action Cards
All quick action cards are interactive and play hover sound effects (when audio is enabled).

## Testing

To test the profile pages:

1. **As a Gamer:**
   ```bash
   # Register as gamer
   Navigate to /signup?role=gamer
   Fill out form and submit
   # Should redirect to /profile/gamer
   ```

2. **As a Developer:**
   ```bash
   # Register as developer
   Navigate to /signup?role=developer
   Fill out form (including indie verification)
   # Should redirect to /profile/developer
   ```

3. **Login Flow:**
   ```bash
   # Login with existing account
   Navigate to /login
   Enter credentials
   # Should redirect to appropriate profile based on role
   ```

---

## Migration Notes

### Old Routes
The old routes still exist but now redirect:
- `/register/developer` ‚Üí `/profile/developer`
- `/register/gamer` ‚Üí `/profile/gamer`

This ensures backward compatibility if users have bookmarked old URLs.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" Error
- **Cause:** No valid session
- **Solution:** User will be auto-redirected to `/login`

### Wrong Profile Page
- **Cause:** User role doesn't match the profile page
- **Solution:** Auto-redirect to correct profile based on role

### Developer Details Not Showing
- **Cause:** Developer didn't complete indie verification during signup
- **Solution:** Developer profile fields will be `null`, only basic info shown
